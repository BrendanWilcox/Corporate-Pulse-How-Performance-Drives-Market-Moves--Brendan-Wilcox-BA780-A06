**Overview***

With an emphasis on identifying correlations between financial statement variables and stock performance/return, this study attempts to assess whether KPIs have historically been linked to a company's future stock performance. In general, investors are frequently advised that they "cannot beat the market," but this project will offer insights to help them overcome many of these obstacles by helping them make better investment selections based on performance and its associated quantitative indicators.

Today, many day trading "savants" swear by methodologies related to investing based on the shape of stock charts and arbitrary metrics without really diving into the companies' operations and seeing how their true performance impacts the stock price. We believe that integrating quantitative investing concepts with data on company quality can offer a more reliable investment strategy than relying on quantitative or qualitative investing alone. The most successful hedge funds have already figured this out, but we believe that we can find interesting insights as well.
